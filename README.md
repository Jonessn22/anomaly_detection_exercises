1. Individual Project Closeout
- Overcommunicate early. Some things feel like "nothing work" so keep stakeholders informed and yourself accountable by investing in planning (e.g. kanban). 
    - Weekly summaries
    - Daily updates

2. 01_about
- The best way to detect outliers is to know your domain.
- One person's noise is another person's signal. Context is important. 
- The decision rule for whether something is an inlier/outlier is usually decided by cost/benefit analysis (FP vs FN).
- Techniques for Detecting Anomalies:
    - Statistical methods
    - Machine learning
        - Support Vector Machine
        - Isolation Forest Anomal Detection
    - Cluster based anomaly detection
    - Density based anomlay detection
- Anomaly detection can be vulnerable to overfitting.
